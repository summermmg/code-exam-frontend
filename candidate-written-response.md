* Overall, this exam is fun and challenging. It requires time management to be able to finish within about two-three hours time frame. 
* From this challenge, I have learned React synthetic event like onContextMenu which is used to detect right mouse click.  
* For the expect behaviours, I used `<Items />` as middle node for communication between `<Item />` and `<AssemblyLines />` which is a method called 'Props Drilling'. However, if there's no time constraints, I would prefer use React Context becasue it provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
